//! Tracing causality acyclicity harness.
//!
//! Models two threads creating a causal cycle:
//!
//! - Thread 0 (A→B): Request r0 → Request r0 (tries to acquire while holding it)
//! - Thread 1 (B→A): Request r0 (blocked by T0-held r0)
//!
//! When T0 holds r0 and then tries to acquire r0 again (self-contention), and T1
//! is also waiting for r0, all threads end up blocked — the classic causal cycle
//! that DPOR will detect as a deadlock.
//!
//! Expected: `OracleVerdict::BugFound`.
