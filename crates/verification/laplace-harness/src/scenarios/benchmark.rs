//! Benchmark stability snapshot harness.
//!
//! Models a stability analyzer racing with a writer thread over a shared
//! metrics resource (r0).  The writer acquires r0 to update metrics; the
//! analyzer acquires r0 to take a consistent snapshot.  Mutual exclusion via
//! the lock prevents torn reads, so the snapshot is always coherent.
//!
//! Expected: `OracleVerdict::Clean`.
