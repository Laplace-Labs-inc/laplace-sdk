//! Telemetry ring buffer concurrency harness.
//!
//! Models the concurrent push scenario from `telemetry_twin_test` (S-TEL3 / S-TEL4):
//! two threads compete for the ring buffer's write-lock (ResourceId 0), push an
//! event, then release the lock.
//!
//! Because exactly one thread holds the write-lock at a time, no torn snapshot
//! or data race can occur.  DPOR exhaustive search must confirm `OracleVerdict::Clean`.
